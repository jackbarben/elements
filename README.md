What I'm doing: 

Building a website to put my music teaching materials on. Built with Node.js, express, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Cloudinary. In present state allows users to 
create an account to upload and share improvisations. Working on add teaching materials slowly to the site, in process.
